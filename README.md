# "Így Jártam Anyátokkal" Tactical Guide


Welcome to the "Így Jártam Anyátokkal" Tactical Guide project, a JavaFX desktop application that brings to life the tactical guide of the famous series. This project was developed during our university studies as a collaborative effort with three of my peers.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in to the application to access personalized content.
- **Page Creation**: Add and manage pages with ease to build your tactical guide.
- **Table of Contents**: Navigate through the guide with a user-friendly table of contents.
- **Book-Inspired Design**: The application's design mimics the style of a real book for an authentic reading experience.
- **Collaborative Development**: The project was created in collaboration with my fellow students to combine our skills and knowledge.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the JavaFX application.
3. Log in using your credentials to access and create content.
4. Enjoy exploring the tactical guide inspired by "Így Jártam Anyátokkal."

## Project Management

We used Trello for project management to keep track of tasks and ensure a smooth development process.

This project was created as an educational endeavor, and we are proud to present the result of our hard work. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide feedback.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your interest in our project!
